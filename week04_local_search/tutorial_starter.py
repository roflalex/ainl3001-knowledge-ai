Week 4 Tutorial
Introducing the Problem Class

In previous weeks, we represented problems directly using
variables and functions.

From this week onwards, we will use a common Problem class
where appropriate.

This tutorial uses the familiar grid world from earlier weeks
to explore the new structure.
"""

from common.problem import Problem


GRID_SIZE = 5


class GridProblem(Problem):
    """
    A simple grid-world problem.

    A state is represented as an (x, y) coordinate.

    Example:

        (0, 0) = top-left corner
        (4, 4) = bottom-right corner

    def actions(self, state):

            UP
            DOWN
            LEFT
            RIGHT

        Remember: an action must not move outside the grid.

# REFLECTION QUESTIONS
# --------------------------------------------------

"""
Be ready to discuss:

1. What information is stored in problem.initial?
    a: initial holds the starting state of the problem. The class stores it and doesnt say what type it is

2. What information is stored in problem.goal?
    a: goal holds the target state that the search is trying to reach
3. What is the difference between:

       problem.actions(state)

   and:

       problem.result(state, action)

    a: .actions tells you what you can do from a state  
       .result tells you what happens if you do one of those things
4. Why doesn't Problem know anything about grids?
    a: Problem is a template for any searhc proble, so it only defines:
        initial state, goal, actions,result and goal_test

5. Why doesn't GridProblem know anything about search?
    a: GridProblem only defines the grid, initial state, the goal, legal moves and what each moves does 
       it says nothing about how to find a solution

6. Could the same Problem structure be used for something
   other than a grid?
    a: Anything that has states, moves between them and 
    a way to tell you've finished can use the structure
