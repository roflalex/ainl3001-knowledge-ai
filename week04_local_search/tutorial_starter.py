Week 4 Tutorial
Introducing the Problem Class

In previous weeks, we represented problems directly using
variables and functions.

From this week onwards, we will use a common Problem class
where appropriate.

This tutorial uses the familiar grid world from earlier weeks
to explore the new structure.
"""

from common.problem import Problem


GRID_SIZE = 5


class GridProblem(Problem):
    """
    A simple grid-world problem.

    A state is represented as an (x, y) coordinate.

    Example:

        (0, 0) = top-left corner
        (4, 4) = bottom-right corner
    """

    def actions(self, state):
        """
        Return the valid actions from this state.

        Possible actions:

            UP
            DOWN
            LEFT
            RIGHT

        Remember: an action must not move outside the grid.

    def result(self, state, action):

# REFLECTION QUESTIONS
# --------------------------------------------------

"""
Be ready to discuss:

1. What information is stored in problem.initial?

2. What information is stored in problem.goal?

3. What is the difference between:

       problem.actions(state)

   and:

       problem.result(state, action)

4. Why doesn't Problem know anything about grids?

5. Why doesn't GridProblem know anything about search?

6. Could the same Problem structure be used for something
   other than a grid?
